This is my first post. I intend to use this blog to document the myriad thoughts I have about work, technology, life, etc. I'm an instrucor at [MakerSquare](http://www.makersquare.com) where I teach Ruby mostly (more on that another time). I've been learning Clojure for a little while now and will probably write about that the most. It's a frustrating, confusing, and fascinating experience so far and maybe the random bits of info I've picked up along the way will be helpful to anyone coming up behind me.

Stay tuned.
